I'm a QA automation and DevOps engineer with a background in Linux system administration and network engineering. I have experience leading QA teams, delivering high-quality end-to-end tests, designing architecture, and implementing highly scalable systems using microservices and serverless architecture.

I enjoy solving challenging technical problems, whether troubleshooting issues with a distributed system or designing a new feature. I believe in the value of collaboration and communication and aim to create a positive team culture.

Here are the most impressive things about me:
- I got my CCNA certificate at 16 years old, followed by CCNP later.
- I use Arch, BTW.
- I interviewed over 170 Manual and Automation QA engineers worldwide.
- I am a Co-Founder of GeoSTQB, Georgian Software Testing Qualifications Board.
- I built one of the first text-to-product AI generator platforms, AI Printed Art.
- I have created the Georgian programming language, Ena, for educational purposes.

My favorite food is Khinkali, but it is hard to have a favorite food when you live in Georgia; everything is top-notch.

If you have any questions I can help with, please feel free to reach out at my email (pgagnidze at pm dot me) I look forward to speaking with you!
