As a QA automation and DevOps engineer, I am driven by complex challenges and innovative solutions. Earning my CCNA at 16 laid a strong foundation in networking, followed by CCNP. This technical background has enabled me to excel in leading QA/DevOps teams, delivering high-quality end-to-end tests, and designing scalable systems using microservices and serverless architectures.

I thrive on solving challenging technical problems, whether troubleshooting distributed systems or designing new features. I believe in collaboration and communication and aim to create a positive team culture.

Highlights:

- Interviewed over 200 Manual and Automation QA engineers worldwide.
- Co-founder of GeoSTQB, the Georgian Software Testing Qualifications Board.
- Built AI Printed Art, one of the first text-to-product AI generator platforms.
- Acquired and enhanced Owloops, a browser automation project.
- Created Ena, the first programming language designed for the Georgian language.

My favorite food is Khinkali, but it is hard to have a favorite food when you live in Georgia; everything is top-notch.
